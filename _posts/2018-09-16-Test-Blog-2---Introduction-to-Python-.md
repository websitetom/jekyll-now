    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>At first, I struggled a bit as it was a brand new challenge and concept for me however after trying lots of different methods I got there. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to ask my partner a few times on certain topics but other than that I didn't ask that many questions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently for the majority of the lesson excluding a few bits where I asked a friend for help.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think in parts I could have persevered a bit more however I think I did Ok.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have resisted a bit more from asking for help in areas as my mindset was that I was starting a new topic and that I didn’t know what I was doing so I just thought to give up all the time rather than really trying to complete the levels on my own and not with anyone’s help at all.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to just not think because it is a new topic and I don’t know what I am doing that I just have to give up and get someone to do it for me. I should just stop and analyse the situation and figure it out on my own like I have been told to do as I will never learn if I just get someone else to do it.</td>
