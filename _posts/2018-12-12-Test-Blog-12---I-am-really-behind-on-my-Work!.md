    <td>Independence</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should have done a lot more work at home as that would have helped a lot in terms of my learning but also in the fact that I wouldn’t have two hours of Homework to do the night before it is due in having already done 2 hours each night of the week.</td>

    <td>I need to be more conscientious at home in order to succeed in I.T. and later life as this lesson doesn’t just apply to school but in life if you work hard it will help you succeed and reach the targets and goals you want to reach in life.</td>
