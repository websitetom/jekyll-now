    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently in order to gain the most information as possible.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I worked pretty well barely asking a few questions to my peers when I needed help.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was very engaged in my work as I wanted to get better at Python coding.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I could have worked slightly more logically as some of the problems I faced I did a lot work but didn't think logically and didnâ€™t read the information I was given very carefully which would have helped a lot more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to think more logically about what the question is actually asking me what to do and how to do it and where to do it. This would improve the overall speed of my coding and my coding in general as well.</td>
