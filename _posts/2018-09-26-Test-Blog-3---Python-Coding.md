<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have coded on Python once before and have now got the gist of it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To improve and learn more about coding but specifically Python Coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Sort of as I know now more, however I did have to ask for help quite a lot.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered a bit however I think I should have focused on me finding the answer rather than my partner. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently for the whole lesson but I also often asked my friend for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I should have just focused on finding the answer myself rather than just every time asking my peer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was very engaged in my work as it was a difficult challenge to complete.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should have just focused on finding the answer and it taking longer rather than just the shortcut of asking my friend who has already done it for the answer and by doing it this way I don't learn anything and I also don’t improve my ability of coding in Python or my mindset in general. </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to next time take the long way round of the challenge by just taking the time to think about it instead of just asking my friend who is clearly more able than me at coding. By doing this I learn nothing, don’t improve my coding in Python and my overall mindset towards challenges we gradually get worse.</td>
