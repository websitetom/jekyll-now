    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have made programmes before however they were using a different website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To begin creating my own programme of my choice using Python coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes as I made a start to my programme with a few lines of code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to persevere as I had never used this website before so I had to get used to it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked some questions about the website as it was a whole new layout to what I knew.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Other than a few questions I worked independently finding out ideas for my game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I could have maybe asked a few less questions and figure them out myself by experimenting.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have experimented a bit more with different buttons and what the function of those buttons were in order to benefit from myself a bit more. Also I could have asked less questions to do with my work in order to not just be given the answers by someone else who has found those answers out themselves. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to experiment more with my work in order to find information out myself and therefore if I do I will benefit a lot more with my learning in the future. By doing this it will mean I won't have to ask as many questions as I will not need to because I will already have the answer to the question.</td>
