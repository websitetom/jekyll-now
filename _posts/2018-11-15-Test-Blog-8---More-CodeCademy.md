  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have enjoyed doing CodeCademy and progressing through the levels.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To continue getting better and better at the problem solving in Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes as I am getting better at coding as I am getting through more and more levels each day.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to persevere as some of the problems were difficult to complete as they required a lot of thinking.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to complete a lot of work which I mostly did on my own but I possibly could have done a bit more on my own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I could have done a bit more work on my own but other than that it went pretty well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was very engaged as I enjoy doing Python and I think it will help me later in life.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have worked on my own a tiny bit better as it would benefit my learning a lot as I would have got the answer not my friend who just showed me what it was and how to do it. This is bad because I don't learn anything.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to think that when I am stuck not to go straight to my peer in search of the answer as that will not benefit me in the future as it will make me a McDonaldâ€™s employee where I am told what to do without figuring it out for myself.</td>
    <td></td>
