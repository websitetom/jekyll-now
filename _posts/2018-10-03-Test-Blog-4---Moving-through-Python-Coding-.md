  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have had a few lessons of Python coding and I know have got to grips with it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To continue on and consolidate my coding in Python. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes as I had the whole lesson to move through the different levels of Python.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered lots barely asking my partner or help as I really tried to get my head down and work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I rarely asked my partner and I only did that when I had tried a lot of different ways.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my own for the majority of the lesson and I didn't really ask my peer for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Overall, I think I did better this lesson as I tried hard to just work on my own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was very engaged in my work as I wanted to learn as much as I could in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Overall, I worked quite hard on just working on my own and not asking that much for help however, I didn’t work through the levels very fast or quickly and therefore I didn’t get through a lot of levels and therefore I also didn’t get onto the more challenging levels which would really test my knowledge.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work independently and not ask much help from my peers and that will also help me get better at Python. Furthermore, I need to work at a good speed in order to get onto the more challenging levels and that will also improve my way of completing Python levels in Coding.</td>
