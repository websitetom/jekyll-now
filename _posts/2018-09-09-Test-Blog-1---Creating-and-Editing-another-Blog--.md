    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I am going to have to persevere in order to remember everything I had learnt in Year 7 which improved my website. </td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I may have to ask some questions in the future when I get stuck on something more challenging that I haven't learnt before.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>However, if I do need help then I will try my best to do it independently as that is the only way I will really learn something.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I enjoyed this task in Year 7 and despite it being hard at times I think I will also enjoy it this year.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Last year I was very engaged in the creation of our blogs as it was the first time and this year I hope I will too.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Last year and in parts of the lesson I easily gave up and instantly asked a peer for help instead of doing what i was taught to do which was to keep going and try every possible way around it and if I still can’t do it then that is the time when I would ask a friend for help with my coding. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to rarely if not never give up on a difficult task as like last year I think many puzzling problems will be thrown at me and it’s when I figure those problems out that I learn the most as it was me and only me who worked it all out.</td>
