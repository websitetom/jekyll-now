  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have for my whole time in IT coded on Github which I have found very good.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To experiment with a new website called thimble which might be easier.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes as now I have an idea of which website I would to continue to code on.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>It was very difficult in patches as it was a brand new website with a whole different setup to Github but I tried to see which one in the long term I would prefer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked many questions to other people who were slightly more experienced at coding on this website than me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Other than questioning some people I worked independently discovering the new way of coding on this website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I could have maybe asked fewer questions and found out some new interesting stuff on my own rather than through someone else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have asked fewer questions on how how to access certain things such as how to get to the HTML part of the code rather than the CSS part and what chunks and bits of code to put where and what the function of each was. But I simply found all of this too complicated and therefore I have stayed on Github.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have found out all of the stuff listed above on my own which could have given me a better impression of the new website and the new layout of this website and this could also have changed my opinion on which one was easier. This might not have helped me now however in the long term it might have.</td>
