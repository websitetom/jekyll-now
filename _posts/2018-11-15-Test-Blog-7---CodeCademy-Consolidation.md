    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Independence</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have done a bit more work at home as it would really help me because although I was working a lot in the classroom if I can't remember what I did then it was pointless and I wonâ€™t be able to use those skills effectively in a problem.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to more work at home as that will influence the consolidation of my skills as a code cracker and problem solver. Also by doing the work at home I will remember the work I did better and find the skills easier.</td>
