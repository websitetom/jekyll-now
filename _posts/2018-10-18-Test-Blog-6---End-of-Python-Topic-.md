  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have done Python for the last few weeks and it has been a challenge in parts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To continue improving my ability on python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes as for the whole lesson I improved my coding on codecademy.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I sat further away from my colleagues so I had to persevere in parts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I barely asked any questions as I tried to really just work on my own without any help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently throughout the lesson away from my peers in order to learn the most.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think sitting away from my friends was a good thing as I learnt a lot more away from them rather than with them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the learning went pretty well as I deliberately sat further away from my friends in order for me to be able to learn more independently and not feel the need to ask then for help as much. But because of this I didn't work as fast as I should have and I therefore didn’t get through as much as I could.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to sit further away from my friends as that makes me work independently and I won’t feel the urge to ask the person who is right next to me for help. But I need to change the pace I work at as it doesn’t get me through CodeCademy very quickly and I’m therefore behind all of my classmates.</td>
